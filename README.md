# Memory Card Game

This is a very simple application that allows you to play a memory game. Each character must be pressed only once to win the game. Each time a character is selected, they change position.
The idea for this project was obtained through www.theodinproject.com. Through this website I started studying programming and I improved a lot since my beginnings.

##Language and Technologies Employed

- This application was developed entirely with **React** with **Javascript**.
- The styling was done through **Styled Components**.
